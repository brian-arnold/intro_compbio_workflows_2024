MissingOutputException in rule fastp in file /scratch/gpfs/bjarnold/intro_compbio_workflows_2024/part2_snakemake/simple_wildcards2/Snakefile2, line 14:
Job 1  completed successfully, but some output files are missing. Missing files after 5 seconds. This might be due to filesystem latency. If that is the case, consider to increase the wait time with --latency-wait:
/2982B_trim_1.fastq.gz
/2982B_trim_2.fastq.gz
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
